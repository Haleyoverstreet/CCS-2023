Total Points: 22

## 1 
Write code to get the greenhouse gas emissions data into your R session as a data frame using the `get_emissions()` function from the {hockeystick} package (4)

## 2 
Using the data frame from question 1, write code to list the largest emitters of methane in the year 2010 by country (4)

## 3
Write code to get the global air temperature data into your R session as a data frame using the appropriate function from the {hockeystick} package and make a time series plot showing July temperatures across the years (6)

## 4
Using the data frame from question 3, write code to quantify the increase per year in global temperatures during the month of July (4)

## 5
According to parcel theory, rising volumes of dry air cool at a rate of how many degrees Celsius per kilometer? How does this lapse rate of temperature compare with the lapse rate for rising volumes of moist (saturated) air? (4)
